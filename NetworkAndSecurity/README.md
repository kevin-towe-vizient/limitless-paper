# Networking

## Ingress/Egress: ensure k8s agents can communicate with Azure DevOps.

- netowrk policies or firewall rules

## Secure Communications

- Use secrets in k8s to manage sensitive information like the personal access token(PAT)

## Agent-to-Agent Communications

- (if) your build pipeliens require inter-agent communication, ensure the required ports and network policies are configured
